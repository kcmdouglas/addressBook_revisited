##Description
Epicodus JavaScript class exercise

##Instructions
Address book
Follow along with the Address Book lessons to add contact objects. Then create and add (or push) address objects to your contact objects. This creates a relationship between the contact object and the many possible address objects that it can store. Complete these items for it too:

Add address type to the addresses entered
Refactor some of the other sections of the jQuery into functions before the document is ready
Check out the .not() function in jQuery documentation and use it to hide any additional address fields on submit.
Try a jQuery method from either the CSS or Effects options in the documentation (e.g. fadeIn() or .css())
Try a jQuery method from the Events options (e.g. hover() or .keypress())
